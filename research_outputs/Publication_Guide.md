## Step 5: Handle Reviewer Feedback

### Expected Feedback Categories

**Likely Reviewer Comments**:
1. ✅ **Strengths**: Multi-model approach, clinical focus, ethical framework
2. ⚠️ **Concerns**: Need for fairness/bias audit, external validation needed
3. 🔧 **Requests**: 
   - Performance on additional datasets
   - Demographic stratification analysis
   - Comparison with human expert assessment
   - Details on cognitive distortion improvement plan

### Responding to Reviewers

**General Strategy**:
```
For each comment:
1. Restate the concern
2. Explain your response
3. Cite evidence or modifications
4. Accept/Reject with justification
```

**Example Response**:

> **Reviewer 1, Comment 3**: "The false negative rate of 10% in risk detection 
> is concerning and may miss at-risk individuals."
>
> **Response**: We acknowledge this is a limitation of any screening tool. 
> We have designed the system with three safety layers:
> 1. Clear communication to users that this is a screening tool only
> 2. Institutional protocol requiring human review of flagged cases
> 3. Hot-line escalation for high-risk scenarios
>
> Additionally, we demonstrate that 97% NPV provides high confidence in 
> negative predictions, making this suitable for triage purposes. We have 
> added text to Section 5.4 emphasizing these limitations and safety 
> requirements for deployment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Should I submit to multiple journals at once?
**A**: Most journals require exclusivity. Submit to your target journal first. If rejected, resubmit elsewhere. Exception: preprint servers (arXiv) allow simultaneous submission.

### Q: How long until acceptance?
**A**: 2-4 months total (submission to acceptance). Top journals may take 3-4 months just for review.

### Q: What if reviewers ask for experiments I can't do?
**A**: Explain limitations honestly. Propose alternative approach or path forward. Reviewers appreciate transparent responses.

### Q: Should I respond to negative reviews?
**A**: Always respond professionally. Address valid concerns. If reviewer is mistaken, politely correct with evidence.

### Q: How many revisions before desk rejection?
**A**: Usually 1-2 rounds. After that, journals may desk-reject if concerns aren't adequately addressed.
