## 📋 Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Q: "The paper seems too long"
**A**: Average AI/medical paper is 8,000-15,000 words. Your paper (~15,000) is appropriate. Many top journals accept longer papers with strong content.

### Q: "Should I include all the ethical considerations?"
**A**: Yes! Healthcare journals increasingly expect ethical frameworks. Your comprehensive treatment is a strength, not weakness. Mental health + AI especially demands this.

### Q: "What if reviewers ask for more rigorous validation?"
**A**: This is common. Your paper acknowledges limitations and proposes future work. If rejected, use feedback to strengthen cognitive distortion model and resubmit.

### Q: "How do I handle the 10% false negative rate criticism?"
**A**: Emphasize that (a) no screening tool is perfect, (b) system is designed for triage not autonomous decisions, (c) 97% NPV provides safety margin, (d) false negatives managed through institutional protocols.

### Q: "Should I try multiple journals simultaneously?"
**A**: No. Submit to target. If rejected, submit to alternative. Exception: conferences (which encourage simultaneous submissions).
